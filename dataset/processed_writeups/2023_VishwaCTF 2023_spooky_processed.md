> I forgot my login credentials again!!

## About the Challenge
We were given a website that has a login form


[Image extracted text: Username
Password
LOGIN]


## How to Solve?
I have trying every single payload to bypass the admin login (SQL and NoSQL) and the result is nothing. And then my friend, @DimasMaulana found an interesting endpoint called `sitemap.xml`

As you can see, we found another endpoint that contain users and password.

### User:
```
user
guest
root
admin
kali
raspberry
support
fiona
charles
alice
pinocchio
shrekop
dragon
donkey
wolf
```

### Pass:
```

```

Im using that username and password wordlist to bruteforce the form and we got 1 correct combination

```
User: shrekop
Pass: VmU5gnXKYN2vLp48
```

Now we can login to the web, but we still didn't get the flag.

As you can see the role is `user`. We need to do privilege escalation from `user` to `admin` roles. To do that, when we login to the website, add `admin` parameter and the value is `true`
