Fun Facts With Encryption Keys
Prof Bill Buchanan OBE

With symmetric key encryption (such as with AES encryption);
an
encryption key is used to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext; and decrypt]


I opened the blog and found that the screenshot was from a paper titled [Post-quantum RSA](https://cr.yp.to/papers/pqrsa-20170419.pdf).
