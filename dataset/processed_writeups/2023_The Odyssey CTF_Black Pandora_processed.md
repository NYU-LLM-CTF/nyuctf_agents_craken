# Black Pandora
> Duncan just traded-off a device with a very promising price at a shop near the town. The seller is even more generous that he offers a program that can give Duncan a huge amount of money. Welp, Duncan is not really aware of the device's security so he just did what the seller tell him to do, and now there's an **annoying popup** that always get opened once he would like to **open a file directory**.

> Can you investigate what's happening on his device?

> Important Notes: Ignore the bitcoin stuff (like Kleopatra/GPG/bitcoin app/related files) as it's not related to the challenge.

## About the Challenge
We were given an image forensic challenge (on a memory). Additionally, we have received 5 questions that we need to answer correctly in order to obtain the flag.

## How to Solve?
In this case, im using Volatility 2 to do forensic on a memory. First, im gonna use `imageinfo` first to find the correct profile for this image. Here is the command I used to find the correct profile:

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem imageinfo
```

As you can see, there are a lot of suggested profiles that you can use, but in this case im gonna use `Win7SP1x64`.  First im using `psxview` module to find hidden process, here is the output and the command when i used `psxview` module

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 psxview
```

Hmmm there is a proccess called `clickheretoget....`. It looks like the name program has been truncated. Let's see the full name using `filescan` module. Here is the command I used to find the full name of the suspicious program

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep "clickhere"
```

The file name is `clickheretogetmoney.exe` and now we need to dump it. But I failed when I want to dump the proccess. So, the next thing I want to do is print list of loaded dlls for each process (Especially clickheretogetmoney process). So im using `dlllist` module just hoping there is `clickheretogetmoney` proccess

```
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 dlllist | grep "Money"
```

For question number 3, we can use `pstree` module to find the PID and the parent PID. Here is the command I used to obtain the pid and ppid

```shell

For question number 5, im using dynamic analysis approach, so I upload the DLL code into Virustotal, and you can find the attacker's IP and port on the behaviour menu


[Image extracted text: Network Communication

The IP and the port is `13.37.73.137:4269`
