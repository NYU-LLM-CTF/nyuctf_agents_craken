## About the Challenge
We need to find the flag inside the `gif` file (You can download the file [here](turtle.gif))

## How to Solve?
If you look at the GIF file, when you watch the GIF, you will notice that in the middle of the video there is a flag that appears very quickly. So I decided to check all the GIF frame using this [website](https://onlinegiftools.com/play-gif)
