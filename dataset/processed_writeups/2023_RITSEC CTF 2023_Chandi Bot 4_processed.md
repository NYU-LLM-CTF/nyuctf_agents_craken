There is a channel called `#chandi-bot` in their discord server, and you can enter the `/` character to see some commands that the bot can run.

Input `/dad` command first to get `1` point or you can skip this step. After that input `/rps` and try to bet 1 point to see the output

As you can see, we lose the game. I have tried this `/rps` command before and the result is we always lose to the bot. To increase the balance even though we lose, we need to input negative balance, for example `-10000` and run `/buy-flag` command
