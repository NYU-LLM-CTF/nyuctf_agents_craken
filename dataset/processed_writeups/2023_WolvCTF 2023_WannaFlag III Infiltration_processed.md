We
are
an
up and coming ransomware group that sabotages these "CTFs
where
wanna be hackers think they
re
soooooooooo coo]
doing this dumb
baby cha] lenges
We71 they
arent.
WE are the ones that
are coo]
These absolutely pathetic NOBODY organizers are
So
busy mak-
their
'guess where the google image
pulled up
in
seconds"
OSINT cha] lenge is they can
even bother
to
secure their
own
infrastucure .
I'm talking
about WolvCTF here because we just sabotaged
one
of their challenges HAHHAHAAHAHAHAHA.
If you want proof here
s the flag from that
dumb OSINT cha] lenge:
[wctf{splnnnNn_tH3_cUb333e3E}
It
5 so easy
to
profit off of these CTFs due
to how the organizers
are basically throwing money
at uS
to get their cha]lenges back _
So
yeahhhhhh
we
ve
basically
made  soooo much money so far
off of hacking CTFS .
We might
as wel1
be bigger than REvi]
at this point _
If you're interested in seeing al1
these CTFs that
we ' ve hacked,
check
out the Tink
below.
pwned CTFS
