FCCID, Q87-WRTS4GV8I, what is the frequency in MHz for Channel 6
ChatGPT
The FCC ID Q87-WRTS4GV81 corresponds to a Linksys wireless router model, and it
does not directly provide information about the specific frequency for Channel 6.In the
context of Wi-Fi networks in the 2.4 GHz band, Channel 6 operates at a frequency of
2437 MHz However; the FCC ID itself doesnt contain this information. If you need
detailed technical specifications for the router; it's recommended to refer to the user
manual or the official documentation provided by the manufacturer:]


It seems we got 2437 for the MHz, and next we can submit it to port 3895
